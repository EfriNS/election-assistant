## Election Assistant — Next.js / Serverless Patterns

### Gemini Free Tier Limits (Critical!)

1. **Check BOTH RPD and RPM before choosing a model** — Free tier limits are per-model and much lower for newer models than for older ones. `gemini-3.5-flash` has RPD=20 (exhausted by 2 users in one afternoon). `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` has RPD=500, RPM=10. Always verify at: Google AI Studio → Explore models → your model → Quotas tab. (#first:2026-06-16)

2. **RPD=20 is useless for user-facing prototypes** — 20 requests/day across all users means a single enthusiastic tester can exhaust it. Minimum viable: RPD≥100 for prototype distribution to friends; RPD≥500 for wider sharing. (#first:2026-06-16)

3. **Turn limit pattern: guarantee users reach results** — For limited-quota AI conversations, cap at N user turns and auto-trigger synthesis on the final turn. Implementation: pass `isFinalTurn: true` to the API route, which appends a synthesis instruction to the system prompt. Benefits: (a) user always gets results, (b) usage is predictable (≤N+1 calls/session), (c) the conversation feels structured rather than open-ended. Originally implemented in the freeform-chat prototype (Prototype D), since removed in favor of the structured-quiz flow that shipped. (#first:2026-06-16)

4. **Detect AI "done" by response content, not external turn counter** — If the AI can self-terminate (system prompt says "after N topics, summarize"), the frontend's turn limit is a fallback, not the primary signal. Detecting synthesis by counting how many party/entity names appear in the response (≥5 = ranking) is more reliable than `turnCount >= MAX_TURNS`. The turn counter stays as an abuse-protection hard cap. Pattern: `const partyMentions = PARTY_NAMES.filter(n => content.includes(n)).length; const isSynthesis = isFinalTurn || partyMentions >= 5`. (#first:2026-06-17)

5. **Post-conversation extraction: fire in background while user reads** — When a conversational AI turn also serves as the "final answer", fire the structured extraction call immediately but don't transition the UI yet. Let the user read the conversational response (which they expected), then show a "מכין תוצאות..." loading indicator, and reveal a CTA button when extraction completes. Never hide the conversational response behind a loading screen — it's the payoff the user waited for. (#first:2026-06-17)

6. **Separate conversation from scoring — two API calls beats one doing both** — Having the chat AI score parties while also collecting preferences (conflating two jobs in one prompt) produces non-deterministic scoring and complicates future grounding. Better: conversation API collects preferences naturally; a second focused extraction API (`/api/results-d`) takes the full transcript and produces structured `{ scores, profile, partyBlurbs }`. The extraction prompt can be carefully crafted without risking the conversational tone. (#first:2026-06-17)

### `responseJsonSchema` reduces but does NOT eliminate malformed-JSON risk (#first:2026-06-30 #corrected:2026-07-02 #corrected:2026-07-05 #corrected:2026-07-10)

**Original (incomplete) fix, 2026-06-30**: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` occasionally generates malformed JSON — missing commas in arrays, property value errors. 5 confirmed failures over 10 days in production, all with grounding data active (longer prompts → more likely to drift). Added `responseMimeType: "application/json"` to the `generateContent` config on the theory that it "constrains the model to output valid JSON."

**Correction, 2026-07-02**: that theory was wrong. Two more production failures happened *after* the mimeType fix shipped. Root cause, found via Langfuse raw-output inspection: `responseMimeType` alone only asks the model to produce JSON-*shaped* text — it does not guarantee correct string escaping. Both failures were Hebrew gershayim/acronym characters (צה"ל, מו"מ) emitted unescaped inside a JSON string value, breaking `JSON.parse` mid-string. This is a real, recurring risk for **any Gemini call generating Hebrew prose that might reference Israeli institutions/acronyms** (military, legal, religious — all acronym-heavy in Hebrew).

**Actual fix**: add an explicit `responseJsonSchema` (or `responseSchema`) alongside `responseMimeType`. This switches on Gemini's structured-output *constrained decoding*, which is supposed to guarantee syntactically valid JSON at the token level regardless of content.

**Correction, 2026-07-05: that guarantee is not airtight in practice.** A production `/api/follow-up` call failed `JSON.parse` (`"Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 981"`) with `responseJsonSchema` already in place — the same unescaped-quote-in-a-Hebrew-acronym failure mode as the original 2026-07-02 bug, just much rarer. Confirmed this is a known, currently-unresolved *upstream* Gemini limitation, not a config mistake on our end:
- Google's own docs (`ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/structured-output`) state output "is syntactically correct JSON" as a guarantee.
- A still-open community report (`googleapis/python-genai#1238`, closed `not planned`, priority P3) documents the exact same class of failure — malformed escaping with non-English text — recurring under constrained decoding.
- Reproduced the specific failing scenario locally against the real API (temporarily exported `buildPrompt`, called it directly 8x with the same topic/dimension/depth context from the failing trace): 8/8 finished with `finishReason=STOP` at 222–324/500 output tokens, zero parse failures. This ruled out `maxOutputTokens` as the cause — it's a rare, non-deterministic generation glitch, not a token-budget problem. Same method (temporarily export the prompt builder, call the real API directly with the failing trace's exact context) is the fastest way to distinguish "config problem" from "rare upstream glitch" for any future incident like this — cheaper and more conclusive than reasoning about it from the truncated Langfuse log alone.

**Hardening applied (2026-07-05), on top of the schema, not instead of it**:
1. **Retry once on parse/shape failure** in all three Gemini-JSON routes (`follow-up`, `score-topics`, `results`) — a fresh API call (not a retry of the same malformed response) on the *same* request when `JSON.parse` (or, for `results`, the `profile`/`partyBlurbs` shape check) fails. Genuine API errors (quota, network) are NOT retried — they propagate immediately, since retrying those wastes a call on an already-known outcome. This is a resilience pattern for a confirmed-stochastic upstream fault, not the "regex-parse-around-it" workaround this project already rejected once (see the CODING-PRINCIPLES real-incident example) — there is no client-side parsing logic added, just one more honest attempt at the same well-formed request.
2. **Explicit prompt instruction**, in addition to the schema: *"When writing a Hebrew acronym that contains an internal quotation mark (e.g. צה"ל, מו"מ, ת"א), use the Hebrew gershayim character ״ (U+05F4), never a plain ASCII double-quote."* This had never actually been sent to the model — it only existed as a code *comment* explaining the historical bug. Added to `follow-up`'s and `results`' prompts (both generate free-text Hebrew); not added to `score-topics` since its schema is pure `{topicId.partyId: number|null}` with no Hebrew string values to escape in the first place (see the item below on checking exposure before assuming a fix applies).

Net effect: eliminates most of the residual risk this rare failure mode still carries, while keeping the underlying acceptance that a small, non-zero rate is a property of the upstream API we don't fully control — the graceful degradation (return null/empty rather than crash) stays as the final safety net regardless.

**Correction, 2026-07-10: the "use gershayim" instruction has a worse failure mode than a parse exception — silent truncation with no error at all.** A user reported a nonsensical follow-up option ("הרחבת סד") in a live session. The actual Langfuse trace (`gemini-follow-up`, 2026-07-08) showed Gemini emitting a plain ASCII quote instead of gershayim inside two acronyms in the *same* response — צה"ל (prologue) and סד"כ (option 1) — while correctly using gershayim for צה״ל elsewhere in that same response (per-mention flakiness, not a systemic misunderstanding). A bare ASCII `"` is JSON's string terminator: each string simply ended there, and the JSON was still syntactically valid afterward (comma → next key), so `JSON.parse` *succeeded* on the truncated fragment. Unlike the 2026-07-05 incident (a thrown exception the retry-once logic catches), this produces valid-but-wrong output that sails straight past every existing safety net and reaches the user.

**Fix: stop asking the model to choose the correct quote character — remove the choice.** Telling it "use gershayim, not ASCII quote" requires 100%-reliable discrimination between two visually-similar Unicode codepoints under sampling, which it evidently doesn't have. Replaced with:
1. **Plain-word substitutes** for the model's own generated prose: הצבא (not צה"ל), משא ומתן (not מו"מ), סדר הכוחות (not סד"כ), תל אביב (not ת"א) — sidesteps the token choice entirely for the acronyms actually seen in production.
2. **Single geresh (׳, U+05F3) as the fallback** for anything not on that list. Not a JSON meta-character, so it cannot break JSON regardless of whether the model types the "correct" glyph or a plain ASCII apostrophe — both are JSON-safe. This is a materially different guarantee than "pick the right one of two options," one of which is catastrophic if missed.
3. For `results`, which must reproduce verbatim platform quotes: the plain-word substitution only applies to the model's own connecting prose (changing an acronym inside a *quoted* excerpt would violate the "cite verbatim" requirement) — verbatim quotes instead get the single-geresh normalization, treated as a punctuation-only substitution that doesn't alter the words being quoted.

Applied to both `follow-up` and `results` (`app/api/follow-up/route.ts`, `app/api/results/route.ts`). Added `tests/acronymQuoteHardening.test.ts` as a regression guard that the new instruction text stays in place — it cannot test Gemini's actual behavior (inherently non-deterministic), only that the prompt hasn't regressed to the old wording. Real verification is the same as 2026-07-05: watch Langfuse/Slack over the following days/weeks, not a single test run.

**Generalizable lesson**: when a model reliably fails to discriminate between two options (A is required, B is catastrophic), look for a reformulation where every option the model might pick is safe — rather than repeating the instruction more forcefully. Here that meant picking a marker character (single geresh) that has no special meaning in the output format at all, instead of a character (gershayim) that's correct-but-risks-being-confused-with-the-one-actually-dangerous-character (ASCII quote).

```typescript
const MY_RESPONSE_SCHEMA = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    prologue: { type: ["string", "null"] },      // nullable via type array
    followUp: { type: ["object", "null"], properties: { /* ... */ }, required: ["question", "options"] },
  },
  required: ["prologue", "followUp"],
};
config: { temperature: 0.7, maxOutputTokens: 500, responseMimeType: "application/json", responseJsonSchema: MY_RESPONSE_SCHEMA }
```

**Verification is honestly hard**: the failure is intermittent (a handful of instances over weeks of traffic), so a live smoke test with acronym-heavy prompts came back correctly escaped both with and without the schema in a small sample — couldn't force a clean before/after reproduction. Treat post-deploy Slack alert volume over the following days/weeks as the real signal, not a single test run.

**Observed in**: `app/api/follow-up/route.ts` (fixed 2026-07-02, commit `b490834`) and `app/api/results/route.ts` (fixed same day, commit `48a166f` — this one had *neither* `responseMimeType` nor a schema at all, and generates Hebrew prose explicitly instructed to quote party platforms verbatim, the exact risk case). Apply the same `responseJsonSchema` pattern to any Gemini route that expects JSON output and generates Hebrew text, not just the ones that have already broken in production — the absence of a reported error isn't evidence of absence of the bug, given how rare/intermittent it is.

**Not every JSON-mode route is exposed, though — check before assuming**: `app/api/score-topics/route.ts` was audited and found *not* vulnerable to this specific bug — its output is pure `{"topicId.partyId": number | null}`, no free-text Hebrew string values at all, so there's no string content for an unescaped gershayim to break. It had a different unconstrained-JSON symptom instead (a regex workaround for the model emitting invalid `+2` instead of `2`, plus a regex-based JSON-blob extraction). Lesson: "generates JSON via Gemini" isn't itself sufficient to flag a route as at-risk for *this specific* bug — check whether the schema's string fields actually carry Hebrew free text before assuming the fix applies verbatim.

**`enum` in a JSON schema eliminates a whole class of "almost valid" values, not just escaping bugs** — fixed `score-topics` (2026-07-02, commit `06ec144`) with a schema where every score property is `{ type: ["integer", "null"], enum: [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, null] }` instead of a generic `{ type: "number" }`. This is stricter than the follow-up/results fixes: it doesn't just guarantee syntactically valid JSON, it guarantees the *value itself* is one of the exact 5 allowed scores (or null) — constrained decoding literally cannot produce `+2`, `3`, or `1.5`. Building the schema's `properties`/`required` dynamically per-request (from the same `topics`/`PARTIES` data already used to build the prompt) also let `required` list every expected key, which structurally prevents the model from silently omitting a party/topic — a guarantee a generic `additionalProperties` schema wouldn't give. When a route's expected values are a small closed set (ratings, categorical labels, scores on a fixed scale), prefer `enum` over a bare type — it's strictly more protective for the same amount of schema code, and it deletes any accompanying "clean up the model's near-miss output" regex.

### Hoist the AI response variable before the try block for catch-block logging (#first:2026-06-30 #reinforced:2026-07-05)

When a Langfuse generation or error logger needs to record the raw AI output on failure, `const text = response.text` declared inside the try block is not accessible in the catch. Pattern:

```typescript
let rawText = "";   // hoisted — accessible in catch
try {
  const response = await ai.models.generateContent(...);
  rawText = response.text ?? "";
  const parsed = JSON.parse(rawText);  // if this throws...
  generation?.update({ output: rawText });
} catch (err) {
  const msg = err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err);
  // ...rawText is available here — include the bad output in the error log
  generation?.update({ output: rawText ? `${msg}\n\nRAW:\n${rawText.slice(0, 500)}` : msg, level: "ERROR" });
}
```

Without hoisting, error traces in Langfuse show only the exception message (e.g. `"Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 403"`), with no way to see what the model actually returned. With hoisting, the malformed output is visible — essential for diagnosing prompt/model issues.

**Reinforced 2026-07-05 — hoisting alone isn't enough if you then truncate what you log.** All three routes hoisted `rawText`/`text` correctly, but `follow-up` and `score-topics` still logged only `rawText.slice(0, 500)` on failure (an arbitrary cap, inconsistent with the *success* path which already logs the full text), and `results` didn't even hoist `text` at all — its catch block logged only `msg`, nothing of the actual output. A real incident's `JSON.parse` error was at character 981 — past the 500-char slice, making the exact malformed text unrecoverable after the fact. Fixed: log the full raw text on failure in all three, matching what success already does. Lesson: when adding failure-path logging, check it captures *at least* as much as the success path does — a truncation limit that felt reasonable when written can silently cut off exactly the range where the real diagnostic value is (the error position is almost never near the start of the output).

### Prompt vs. Client Fix: Fix Root Cause First, Keep Defensive Strip (#first:2026-06-26)

When the AI produces malformatted output (e.g., numbered option text "1. text" when options should be plain), fix the prompt FIRST — then keep a lightweight defensive transform in the client as a silent safety net.

**Wrong order:** add a client-side regex strip → declare it fixed.
**Right order:**
1. Identify WHY the AI produces the format: the prompt format instruction says `"options": ["...", "...", "..."]` but never says "don't number items". The AI interprets the list structure as an invitation to number.
2. Add an explicit negative instruction to the prompt: *"Write plain text only — do NOT number the options (no '1.', '2.', etc.) — numbers are added by the UI."*
3. Keep the client strip (`opt.replace(/^\d+[\.\)]\s*/, "")`) as a fallback that fires silently if the model deviates.

Rationale: the prompt fix addresses non-determinism at the source. The client strip catches rare regressions without cluttering logs or user experience. This pattern (fix upstream + silent defensive layer) applies to any AI output format issue. (#first:2026-06-26)

### Error Handling (Never Expose Raw SDK Errors)

4. **Translate API errors to structured codes at the boundary** — The Gemini SDK throws errors whose `.message` is a raw JSON blob (includes the full HTTP response). Passing this to the frontend shows incomprehensible text to users. Always inspect the error at `route.ts` and return `{ errorCode: "QUOTA_EXCEEDED" | "AUTH_ERROR" | "SERVER_ERROR" }`. Map in the UI to friendly Hebrew strings. (#first:2026-06-16)

   Detection heuristics (in `route.ts`):
   - Quota: `message.includes("429") || message.includes("RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED")`
   - Auth: `message.includes("401") || message.includes("403") || message.includes("API_KEY")`
   - Default: `SERVER_ERROR`

### LLM Observability (Langfuse)

5. **Helicone new signups are closed** — As of 2026-06, us.helicone.ai shows "New signups are disabled". Use Langfuse instead. (#first:2026-06-16)

6. **Langfuse: use direct SDK, not OTel, for Next.js serverless** — The direct SDK (`import { Langfuse } from "langfuse"`) is simpler than the OpenTelemetry-based wrapper for serverless API routes. Pattern:
   ```typescript
   const lf = new Langfuse({ secretKey, publicKey, baseUrl });
   const trace = lf.trace({ name, sessionId, metadata });
   const gen = trace.generation({ name, model, input });
   // ... call AI ...
   gen.update({ output }); gen.end();
   await lf.flushAsync(); // CRITICAL for serverless
   ```
   `flushAsync()` is mandatory: serverless processes exit immediately after response, before background flush completes. (#first:2026-06-16)

7. **Pass sessionId from client for conversation grouping** — Generate `sessionId` with `crypto.randomUUID()` in the React client on mount (`useState(() => crypto.randomUUID())`). Send it with every API request body. Use it as Langfuse `sessionId` to group all turns of one conversation. This lets you view a full conversation in Langfuse traces. (#first:2026-06-16)
