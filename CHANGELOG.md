## 2026-06-14 — Solution Design + Prototyping Approach

### Decisions Made

**Prototyping strategy**: Build 4 clickable UX prototypes before committing to a technical approach. Show to real users (voters) and the advisor for feedback. Prototypes vary on *how questions are asked* — the highest-leverage UX decision.

**4 prototypes defined** (see `docs/SOLUTION-DESIGN.md` for full rationale):
- **A — הצהרות (Statements)**: Classic agree/disagree binary quiz, 25–30 questions, linear flow. Wahl-O-Mat model.
- **B — עדיפויות (Priority-First)**: User weights 8–10 topic areas first, then answers deeper questions on their top priorities only.
- **C — דילמות (Dilemmas)**: Concrete trade-off scenarios instead of abstract ideological statements.
- **D — שיחה (Conversation)**: AI-guided structured dialogue; structured rubric underneath, conversational surface on top.

**Tech stack decided**:
- Framework: Next.js (React), scaffolded in this repo
- Hosting: Vercel (already connected to GitHub; auto-deploys on push)
- AI (prototype D): Google Gemini free tier (`gemini-2.0-flash` via `@google/generative-ai`)
- Language: Hebrew from the start; RTL layout

**Rejected approaches** (with rationale in `docs/SOLUTION-DESIGN.md`):
- Lovable: Free tier too limited for 4 prototypes; vendor lock-in; poor RTL support
- Claude.ai "skill"/Project: Requires Claude accounts (barrier for general public); no reproducible results; opaque to users

**Gemini API key**: stored in `.env.local` (gitignored) for local dev; Vercel environment variable for deployment. Pattern follows cv-refinery project.

### Infrastructure
- `.gitignore` updated for Node.js / Next.js artifacts
- `docs/SOLUTION-DESIGN.md` created

## 2026-03-28 — Project Kickoff + Competitive Research

### Project Setup
- Created `README.md` (public-facing), `README.txt` (superseded, to delete), `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TODO.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `.gitignore`
- Initialized git repo with `main` branch; created private GitHub repo at https://github.com/EfriNS/election-assistant
- `Screenshots/` excluded from repo (internal reference material)
- `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` excluded from initial commit (internal Claude Code scaffolding)

### Requirements Captured (`REQUIREMENTS.md`)
Key decisions documented:
- **Goal**: Free public tool matching Israeli voters to parties by values; Hebrew-first, multilingual
- **Audience**: General public, wide distribution
- **Data**: Official party platforms only; verbatim quotations with source URL + date; no social media
- **Parties**: All parties; explicit "no platform available" for those without one
- **Curation**: Semi-automatic ingestion + human (advisor) review
- **Cost cap**: ~$50/month
- **Interaction model**: Hybrid — structured quiz engine + AI explanation layer (not freeform chatbot)
- **Open questions** explicitly preserved (technical approach, question design, pipeline design, cost model)

### Competitive Research (`docs/COMPETITIVE-RESEARCH.md`)
**Israeli landscape:**
- No active VAA exists for Israel; the only one ever built (JPost/IDI, 2009) is dead
- Proven demand: 600K users in a single election with no marketing infrastructure
- Other Israeli tools (HaMadad, Kaplan map, Elector) are not party-matching tools

**International tools analyzed:**
- Wahl-O-Mat (Germany): binary quiz, 38q, parties self-report, ~26.5M uses/election; most trusted globally
- Vote Compass (Vox Pop Labs): 6-point slider, 30–40q, 2D compass visualization, media partnerships
- ISideWith (US/global): 70–100q with nuance follow-ups, editorial party data, best mobile UX
- Kieskompas (Netherlands): 30q, expert-calibrated 2D placement, strongest academic methodology
- Smartvote (Switzerland): 75q, individual candidate matching, self-reported data

**Academic research findings:**
- VAAs increase turnout 8–22%; shift vote preferences 1–10%
- Optimal question count: 30–35 (completion drops sharply above 40–50)
- Importance weighting improves match quality but only 20–30% use it when optional → make it mandatory
- Framing bias, populist inflation, and algorithmic opacity are the top design pitfalls
- Users specifically distrust chatbot-style VAAs on political topics

**Gap analysis — our differentiators:**
- Verbatim quotations from official platforms: 0 out of all major tools do this
- Coalition modeling (which coalition scenario do I enable?): 0 out of all major tools do this; globally unique; highly relevant to Israel
- Hebrew-first multilingual (Hebrew + Arabic + Russian + English)
- Active Israeli VAA: first in 12+ years
- Israel needs 3–4 political axes (security, religion/state, socioeconomic, Arab-Jewish) — standard 2D model is inadequate

### Interaction Model Defined (`REQUIREMENTS.md`)
Documented the hybrid model rationale:
- Structured quiz = engine (deterministic, auditable, consistent)
- AI = explanation + adaptation layer (follow-up depth, result narrative, quotation surfacing, tone)
- Freeform chatbot as primary interface explicitly ruled out (inconsistency, opacity, hallucination risk, trust research)
